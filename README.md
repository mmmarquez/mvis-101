## Important Things to Remember
- Help is always a click away; via the internet, your peers, or emailing me. Remember to do homework ahead of time so that you can get questions to me 48 hours before class.
- Mistakes are great ways to learn. Be courageous, fail flamboyantly, and know that you tried your best. Don't let fear or mistakes stand in your way of learning and creating.
- Participation and collaboration are integral parts of this class's culture. This also means you come prepared to all of the classes, do the homework, and be engaged.
-  Share what you learn along the way and collaborate with your peers. We are embodying an open source education model.
- You get one unexcused absence, the next diminishes your grade and the third gets an F. Please provide me with a doctors note if you are sick. Talk to me if you have an extended leave of absence.
