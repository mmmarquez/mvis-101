### Important Things to Remember
- Help is always a click away; via the internet, your peers, or emailing me.
- Mistakes are great ways to learn. Be courageous, fail flamboyantly, and know that you tried your best. Don't let fear or mistakes stand in your way of learning and creating.
- Participation and collaboration are integral parts of this class's culture. This also means you come prepared to all of the classes, do the homework, and be engaged.
-  Share what you learn along the way and collaborate with your peers. We are embodying an open source education model.

### Deadlines
All projects and homework are to be completed and submitted by Saturday afternoon prior our regular class session. Unfinished work will not be discussed in class, however, once completed, documentation of late work can be submitted directly to me.

### Submitting Homework
Homework should be submitted in the respective assignment on Canvas.

### Submission Structure
**Folder structure** is very important in this course and can teach us about best practices. Please follow accordingly.

Folder contents will change between assignments, but keeping the **same structure** ensures consistency and many other benefits.
