## Review

Let's take a couple of minutes to go over what we learned last lesson.

* HTML, CSS, JS
* Project Structure
* JavaScript Libraries

## Lesson Content

As we dig deeper in JavaScript, it only makes sense to use the editor for everything. Please check out the project sample under Resources / Code at the top of the page. Here we have our lesson with comments and working code.

* Download the code files under Download Examples
* Use d3-starter folder as your project folder.
* Follow along the content in the script.js

Alternatively, you can download the Code Examples here:
