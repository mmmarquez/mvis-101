# Hello!

## Today:
- Finish Animation
- Processing Animation
- Upload Canvas
- Bare Controller as MIDI to MadMapper
- Document Installations
- Michelle gives Artist Talk
- Discuss Reading

## Collaborative Machine

1. Make an animation using Processing
  - add safeFrame() to your drawloop
  - tools > move maker
  - locate file where your saved frames are
  - "create movie"
2. Make a trigger marker to play the projected Animation

Mad Mapper:
1. Add the Animation
2. Set it to loop once
3. Upload “Midi_interface_generic” to the Bare controller
4. Plan the electrodes - layout the buttons. connect to copper tape on the back with a nail or wire or pin.
5. Open the MIDI control settings in Mad Mapper. Select the animation you want to control with the Touch Board, then click the “Goto beginning” button, then touch the electrode you want to use, for example, electrode 0. The “Goto beginning” button should now be grey and have something written across it.
6. Paint the button.  

Installation Obstacles:

1. Where is the projector in relationship to the computer (longer micro usb cable to controller or longer VGA to projector?)
2. Do you need it tilted up or down or stacked (be careful, projector bulbs are SUPER expensive)
3. How far apart are the triggers? The longer the traces, the more resistance and less sensitive to touch. Using wire for longer distances

Collaboration Obstacles:

1. Communicate with care and compassion
2. Instead of "no", "or" or "and"
2. Try things even if it is not your idea
3. Don't take anything personally
4. Do your best

## homework

- Finish the Reading from last weeks folder.
- Come with one installation from the reading that spoke to you
    - What is the aim of this installation?
    - How is it pushing boundaries of art that came before it?
    - We will discuss at the beginning of class next week.
