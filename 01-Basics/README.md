## Intro

The following slideshow presents the beginnings of interactive installation. This will just scratch the surface. This week's reading will go much more in depth with the history of installation art.

## Syllabus

Next week, we will be making interactive video installations in class using Bare Conductive Touch boards and MadMapper.

["Hidden Stories"](http://www.redpaperheart.com/work/hiddenstories), Red Paper Heart, 2015

"The exhibit addresses storytelling possibilities of using the 5 senses. Our submission, “Hidden Stories,” explores the secret lives of inanimate objects and the power of listening."

## Resources
Two teams of seven. Each choose a Rube Goldberg Invention with at least seven steps in it.
[Link](https://www.rubegoldberg.com/artwork/send-late-stayer-home/?c=45)
Each person should choose a step in the machine and make an animation in processing that evokes what happens in that step. It can be abstract or pictorial. I will show you how to turn it into a .mov file next week.
Next week, you will also design and print or fabricate a physical trigger for the mapped, projected animation. You can start planning that for homework too.  

## Resident Engineer Workshops

Spring 2018 Workshops with MICA Visiting Engineer Paul Mirel
Sponsored by MICA's Office of Graduate Studies

Who can come?
MICA Faculty, Staff, Graduate, Undergraduate, Open Studies Students

You can attend any of these hands-on workshops. You can attend as many as you like or just one. There are no prerequisites. The workshops are not sequential. There is no charge for the workshops.

Where are the workshops?
In the dFab Classroom, S120, in the MICA Station Building, 1400 Cathedral St.

When are the workshops?
Sundays, 3pm to 5pm. See dates below in the workshop list.

What should I bring with me?  
A laptop computer is helpful to have with you.

January 28 -- Mimic nature with an electronic control system.
Why is it so hard to swat a fly? How does the fly know that you are trying to swat it? Flies react to changing light levels. When it starts to get darker fast, as it might when a hand or a bird approaches, the fly's nervous system identifies that as dangerous, and moves the fly away from the danger. We will build and program a circuit to react to changing light levels as a fly does.
Come learn about how to conceive of and build and program an electronic control system.


February 4 -- Control Systems Follow-up.
Have an idea for a control system? Want to try the Fly Mimic control system again?
Come to consult with Paul on matters pertaining to electronic control systems. Come practice with the Fly Mimic system.


February 11 -- Building Electronics: Best Practices
Do you want to use electronics in your artwork? Do you want to make them easy to debug, for when they inevitably stop working? Do you want those electronics to work during Crit? During exhibition?
Learn how to plan, organize, assemble, and package electronics systems to make them both reliable and easy to service. We will build a system, discuss components, wiring, connectors, and power, and how to make your systems modular for ease of testing.


February 18 -- Using Transistors to Drive Powerful Electronic Components
Do you want your art to move? Do you want to control bright lights? Water pumps? Fans?
Learn how to build transistor circuits to control motors and lights.
Transistors are the fundamental unit of modern electronics. Learn how to use them.

February 25 -- Transistors Follow-up
What powerful electronic thing do you want to control? How did that transistor circuit go together?
Come to consult with Paul about transistors and how to use them. Come practice with the components.
