## Data Art

- Data is critical raw material; i.e. names, amounts, groups, statistics, dates, values, locations, ect.

- Raw data is represented in tabular formats

- In order to derive understanding we need to see it in a visual form - this is the act of **data representation**

- This concerns choices made about the form in which it will be visually displayed
  - size of geometric areas
  - when data is represented in 3d
  - axis - origin value at 0?
  - ratios (height vs width)

- Data Presentation: is more concerned with the visible design including choices of interactivity, features of annotation, color, ect.
  - axis annotation?
  - inconsistent color usage
  - spatial layout
- The goal of data visualization is to facilitate understanding.

Adrien Segal, ["TIDAL DATUM of KACHEMAK BAY"](https://www.adriensegal.com/kachemak-bay-tidal-datum)
"The tidal range in Kachemak Bay is one of the greatest in the world. Tidal Datum is a data sculpture that represents a full cycle of tidal ebbs and floods in three dimensions. Twenty-nine daily tide charts of the verified water level recorded at the National Oceanographic & Atmospheric Administration’s tide station in Seldovia were translated into hand bent steel and framed in a wood structure made from walnut. At the lowest, the water level is 4’ below sea level and 21’ above sea level at its highest."

Adrien Segal, ["California Water Rights"](https://www.adriensegal.com/california-water-rights)
"Strands of ball chain hang from a meandering metal river. Each strand represents 1,072 of the largest permitted water users in California. The length of each strand correlates to the amount of water each user holds the right to, and the color represents the type of entity. This permanent architectural installation in the atrium of an office building spans 3 floors. Each ball represents 1 acre-foot of water, or just under 326,000 gallons. There are over 11,000 feet of ball chain in the sculpture, conveying the immense amount of water allocated - greater than how much water is naturally available. The sculpture allows the viewer to directly experience and gain knowledge about the current water allocation system and to consider where our priorities as a society are in how we manage shared and precious resources."

- How transparent are we with the audience about the data:
  - where it comes from?
  - calculations / modifications
  - inclusion / exclusion?

[Roopa Vasudevan, "hate couture"](http://rouxpz.com/hate-couture/) is a series of high-fashion garments created through analysis of the usage and context of hate speech on the internet.

- Subject matter knowledge
  - what might the audience know or not know about the subject?
  - What do you want to know or communicate about the subject?
  - how might the previously discussed choices impact how it communicates
  - What are the most important aspects to communicate about Water quality?

Formulating a project will be based on the following questions that we will ask ourselves and possibly Eileen on our field trip:
  - Why are we doing this project? What is the motivation behind visualizing the water quality data?
    - Personal Intrigue: 'I wonder what...'
    - Audience Intrigue: 'They need to know...'
    - Project Purpose: 'Do I want to shock, inspire, help understand...'

[Dear Data](http://www.dear-data.com/theproject) is a year-long, analog data drawing project by Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec. "Each week, and for a year, we collected and measured a particular type of data about our lives, used this data to make a drawing on a postcard-sized sheet of paper."

## Assignment: Dear data
Aa a group, select **something in your life that has an environmental impact**, such as plastic bottles consumed, and do a week long dear data study of it.

- The front of your postcard should only feature the visualization.
- On the reverse, include a legend to explain your work.
- You can use any shapes, colors, or materials you want, just as long as it fits on a postcard. But be creative! Can you move beyond a bar chart?
- Set up a main question, i.e. How many plastic disposable items do I use in a day? What brand are they?
- Then set up additional questions: i.e. what time of day do I consume them? Where do I consume them? What type of plastic is it? What's inside?

[Tips from Giorgia & Stefanie](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-data-and-fivethirtyeight-want-you-to-visualize-your-podcast-habits/):
- **Record your data in real time.** Set up a log on a piece of paper, or on your phone, and make sure you record your data right away, rather than waiting until the end of the day. That will make sure your data is more accurate.
- **Try to collect everything you can.** Allow yourself a way to add any miscellaneous details. They might be important later!
- **Be honest!** No cheating, no fudging of the data — personal discovery comes through being honest with yourself.

At the end of the week, analyze and visualize your data:

- **Start looking for patterns, identify categories and anomalies.** You can use different colors to highlight the different categories and start “seeing” them.
- **Visually count your logs.**  You can use simple tally marks to get a sense of the numbers, the quantities, and then play with simple attributes. Every mark represents one of your logs and even merely color-coding these offers a chance for insight. Try alternative ways of sorting your data and see what jumps out: Use colors to see patterns, highlight anomalies, visualize only a subset with more attributes, etc.
- **How do you want to tell your story?** Starting from your analysis, identify how you want to tell your data’s story. Chronologically? Per group of entries? Per importance or rankings of the entries? Geographically? This will lead you to decide the “architecture” (or layout) of your data drawing. Choose what feels best for your data and start to play around.
- **Create your personal legend with your personal rules for visualization.** Assign your entries visual attributes according to your analysis. What do different shapes and colors represent, for instance?
