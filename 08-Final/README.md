* `Casually` discuss final projects.
* Go over a few examples.
* Very basic Github overview.
* Build: Interactive map as a reusable component.

### üìà Thanks to all! üìâ

## Review Projects

## Github

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

* 1.  Create
* 2.  Branch
* 3.  Clone
* 4.  Commit

I created some examples so you can refer back if needed. I'll be updating this repo as much as I can -- with experiments or whatever project related to D3.js or data.

### D3 Examples

### Hello World Project

## Build: Map

We'll be building a simple map using Mapbox. Personally, Mapbox allow us to lay this project quicker -- not worrying that much about the topojson part of building in D3.js.

We are building this in a reusable manner, as a function. We can pass parameters to the function and it will generate a map based on the data we provided.

This will help us understand the importance of a modular approach and reusable components -- functions in other words.

### geojason.io

We can create a geoJason formatted file with points we add.

Refer to `~/code/mapbox-example` and follow along. We'll then see the final under `~/code/mapbox-function` as a reusable component.
